Hello, all. Clearly, my name is Danny Miracle and I am attempting to learn to use github.com and git bash for a class I am participating in called CodeYOU. In the future I will put any work created for class or any work I create on the side in this repository. If you are curious about me, I grew up when the internet was introduced. In high school I won the "cisco" award, I done my senior project on VoIP. No one had a clue what that was back then, now everyone has a cell phone LOL. Life happened and I never finished with computers, however, I always kept one close by...Now at the ripe age of thirty eight I am again pursuing a lifelong goal of learning to program. I look forward to working with you all! </p>
